*Free Guy is a great new movie. I have heard some say that the movie is gonna be bad, since a lot of movies that are about video games have had bad feedback. Movies like Pixels have gotten quite a bad reputation. But this movie doesn't disappoint.*

Free Guy came out when theaters started opening worldwide, which was great timing. 20th Century Fox started producing this movie in May 2019, which was a very long time ago. But that's not the craziest part, since the actual production already started in 2016! The cast is great. Joe Keery from Stranger Things, Séan William McLoughlin aka Jacksepticeye, Jodie Comer and so many other great people are playing a role. By the way, if you don't want to see spoilers,  I'm warning you; there will be some spoilers, so I recommend watching the movie before reading any further.

The basic plot is that a guy named Guy is an npc (non-playable character) who works at a bank in a video game, called Free city, but he doesn't know that he’s in a video game. Free city is basically what you could assume it to be; a free city. The real players within the game are the ones who wear glasses. Guy says that they are the heroes, but then gets robbed by one when he is working, so I don’t think most of them are the heroes. When Guy and his best friend Buddy get out of the situation, Guy gets distracted by a woman who walks past him. He immediately gets attached and starts following her.

The woman is one of the sunglasses people. Guy starts following her and gets run over by a train. After that Guy wakes up on the exact same day. Everything that happened the day before, happens on that day too. On the next day, when the robber comes, he goes in and defends himself. It’s a real player who's robbing him, and in the game the characters can’t do anything against you. And that's where the movie really starts. Guy gets the glasses of the player and then becomes one of the sunglasses people. Well, I can't start explaining the whole movie right now, but think of it as something like The Matrix or other movies where fiction becomes reality.

Overall, the movie is incredible. If you like action, video games, or are just open-minded to any kind of movies in general, you should totally watch Free Guy. The movie is gonna be theater-exclusive for a while and won't really be on streaming services any time soon. It has appearances of people who aren't known from their acting, really funny scenes and it’s really great. I mean, just look at this.
