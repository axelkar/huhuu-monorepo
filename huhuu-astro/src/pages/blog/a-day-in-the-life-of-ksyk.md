<span style="textAlignment:center;">*A tip for all those who are suffering from this horrible thing called “lähi-etäopetus”: the only way to survive through it is…. (drum roll, please) to have GREAT SNACKS! And oh, just a reminder for all those who are taking part in the matriculation examinations this spring: snacks are the most important part. They make the experience a little more tolerable.*</span>

<span style="textAlignment:center;">*During these times when all you see from people are their computers and masks it’s nice to have people who decorate their computers in personal ways. Please do it more! Be brave!*</span>

<span style="textAlignment:center;">*Study hallis a popular hangout spot during breaks, as it is in the middle of the school building. It is easy to run to your next lesson from there after relaxing on the sofas with some friends. Study hall can get especially loud during afternoons when students get tired again.*</span>
